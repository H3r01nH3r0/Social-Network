# Social-Network
<p>Full stack pet-project.
<p>BackEnd - FastApi;
<p>FrontEnd - React-JS;
<p>At the moment, only news content works, user can create an account, log in, create posts (you can insert text and pictures), update and delete your posts, like each other's posts.
<p>In the near future I plan to implement online chats, add the ability to change your profile (set avatars, add biography, etc.).
<p>As a database I use PostgreSQL, but you can use any database that is supported by sqlalchemy.
<p>At first I wanted to implement the front-end using FastApi templating, but then I decided to do it with React for a better understanding of the front-end (this is my first js project so don't be harsh xD).
<p>When writing the back-end, I tried to stick to REST principles for writing endpoints, CRUD for database services and FastApi best practices for structuring the project.
